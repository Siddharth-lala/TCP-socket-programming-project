1. First Run the server.py file otherwise client will not be able to run and establish connection with the server. 
2. then run client1.py client2.py client3.py [all in different terminals][you can create more clients but copying the client code into a new file and running that on another terminal like the previous steps]

After the connection of the clients server is established, the communication happens between the clients and the server gets a receipt of the communication. 

Now send messages between the clients. And also view the server terminal. 
Thanks!
